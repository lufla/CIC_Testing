#todo communcation and python code for current, temperature, can, crosstak




#todo call all functions when needed:
#start taking the temperature,
#voltage test parallel,
#current test parallel (only if voltage is okay),
#CAN test short (10 msg only to check if it works in general),
#for CAN do A, B and both,
#then crosstalk with 10msg,
#if all looks fine with sent and receive as expected,
#heat up for 9 min with high voltage, high current,
#then make 1000msg channel A, then 1000 B, then 1000 A and B,
#thenn 1000 crosstalk test (this can be integrated into the CAN part)
